            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a programming student based in Kansas. I have been learning programming on and off for a few years. Whether it's seeing a project through from start to end or working to further improve a preexisting product, I find programming and development to be an engaging, fulfilling task.</p>
            <p>Other than the KU Bootcamp, I have a minor in computer sciences from my studies at Washburn University. I came to realize quickly during my coursework there that this was something I found genuine joy in doing. I view any projects sent my way as a means to both showcase my acquired skills and to continue to polishing and improving them.</p>

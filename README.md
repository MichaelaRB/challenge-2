# challenge-2

## Description

As a programming student focusing on web development, I want to be able to create a portfolio that not only provides links to other projects, but in itself is a functional project for potential employers to see. I want the site to have functionality and be responsive, but also visually appealing so as to gain attention to my work by potential employers. In creating this portfolio, I have used CSS in order to style every element on the site.
